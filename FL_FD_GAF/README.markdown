# Step-by-Step Explanation of the Fall Detection Training Process

This document provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the training process in the `fall_detection_training` directory of the `SohaibAShah/Federated-Learning-based-Fall-Detection-with-Multimodal-Data-Fusion` repository. The pipeline implements a federated learning approach for fall detection using the UP-Fall Detection Dataset, which includes multimodal data from wearable sensors and cameras. The process involves loading preprocessed data, initializing a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, distributing data across clients, training in a federated manner, and evaluating the model. The explanation assumes the preprocessing pipeline (`fall_detection_preprocessing`) has generated `Train_data.pkl` and `Test_data.pkl`, and incorporates modifications to fix errors (e.g., shape mismatch, tensor warnings) as provided in previous responses.

## Overview
The training pipeline is designed for federated learning, where multiple clients (representing subjects) train local models on their data, and a central server aggregates these updates to improve a global model. The dataset consists of fused sensor and camera data, where each sample is a 3x140x140 tensor (3 channels: GAF accelerometer, GAF angular velocity, camera difference image) for one of five sensors (Ankle, RightPocket, Belt, Neck, Wrist). The model classifies activities into 11 classes (Activities 1–11).

### Step 3: Prepare Datasets (main.py)
- **File**: `main.py`
- **Action**: Flatten the sensor data and create `MyDataset` instances for training and testing.
- **Details**:
  - **Flattening**:
    - Iterate over `train_data` and `test_data`.
    - For each `(Subject, Activity, Trial)` key, extract the five sensor arrays (`data[:-1]`) and the label (`data[-1]`).
    - Append each sensor’s 3x140x140 array as a separate sample to `train_inputs` or `test_inputs`, with the corresponding label to `train_labels` or `test_labels`.

  - **MyDataset (dataset.py)**:
    - Converts inputs to `torch.tensor` with `dtype=torch.double` (matching `model.double()`).
    - Converts labels to `torch.tensor` with `dtype=torch.int64`.
    - Implements `__len__` (returns number of samples) and `__getitem__` (returns a tensor and label pair).
  - **Console Output**:

      - "Test combinations: 164"
      - "Training samples (flattened): 1645"
      - "Test samples (flattened): 820"
      - "Sample shape: torch.Size([3, 140, 140])"
- **Purpose**: Transforms the dictionary-based fused data into a flattened format suitable for the CNN model, where each sensor’s data is an independent sample.

### Step 4: Initialize Model (main.py)
- **File**: `main.py`, `model.py`
- **Action**: Initialize the `MyModel` CNN and prepare it for training.
- **Details**:
  - **Model Definition (model.py)**:
    - `MyModel` is a CNN with:
      - **Conv1**: `nn.Conv2d(3, 3, kernel_size=3, stride=1)` → Output: (3, 138, 138).
      - **Activation1**: `nn.Softsign()`.
      - **Pool1**: `nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)` → Output: (3, 69, 69).

      - **Activation2**, **Pool2**, **Dropout2**, **BatchNorm2**: Similar to above → Output: (6, 33, 33).
      - **Conv3**: `nn.Conv2d(6, 12, kernel_size=3, stride=1)` → Output: (12, 31, 31).
      - **Activation3**, **Pool3**, **Dropout3**, **BatchNorm3**: → Output: (12, 15, 15).
      - **Flatten**: `nn.Flatten()` → Output: 12 × 15 × 15 = 2700.
      - **FC1**: `nn.Linear(2700, 11)` → Output: 11 (logits for 11 classes).
    - Input shape: `(batch_size, 3, 140, 140)`.
    - Output shape: `(batch_size, 11)`.
  - **Initialization**:
    - `model = MyModel()`: Create model instance.
    - `model = model.double()`: Set weights to `float64` to match input data.
    - If CUDA is available (`torch.cuda.is_available()`), move model to GPU: `model = model.cuda()`.
  - **Console Output**: Prints "Initializing model...".
- **Purpose**: Sets up the CNN to process 3x140x140 inputs and predict one of 11 activity classes.

### Step 5: Initialize Server and Clients (main.py)
- **File**: `main.py`, `server.py`, `client.py`
- **Action**: Create a `Server` and 15 `Client` instances, distributing training data by subject.
- **Details**:
  - **Server Initialization (server.py)**:
    - `server = Server(model, test_dataset, num_clients_per_round)`:
      - `model`: Global CNN model.
      - `test_dataset`: 820 samples for evaluation.
      - `num_clients_per_round = 12`: Number of clients selected per round.
      - Creates a `DataLoader` for `test_dataset` with `batch_size=32`.
  - **Client Data Distribution**:
    - Create a dictionary `subject_keys = {i: [] for i in range(1, 18) if i not in [5, 9]}` for 15 subjects.
    - Iterate over `train_data` keys `(Subject, Activity, Trial)`:
      - For each key, append each sensor’s 3x140x140 array and label to `subject_keys[subject]`.
      - Result: Each subject has ~110 samples (e.g., Subject 1: 11 activities × 2 trials × 5 sensors = 110 samples).
    - Total samples across all subjects: 1645.
  - **Client Initialization**:
    - For each subject (1–17, excluding 5 and 9):
      - Create `client_dataset = MyDataset(client_inputs, client_labels)` with the subject’s samples.
      - Initialize `Client(model, {c: client_dataset}, id=c)`:
        - `model`: Copy of the global model.
        - `train_dataset`: Dictionary `{client_id: client_dataset}`.
        - Creates a `DataLoader` with `batch_size=32`.
    - Result: 15 clients, each with a local model and dataset.
  - **Console Output**: Prints "Initializing server and clients...".
- **Purpose**: Sets up the federated learning framework, where each client (subject) trains on their local data, and the server aggregates updates.

### Step 6: Federated Training (train.py)
- **File**: `train.py`, `client.py`, `server.py`
- **Action**: Run the federated learning loop for `num_epochs` rounds, training local models and aggregating updates.
- **Details**:
  - **Function**: `train_federated_model(server, clients, num_epochs, num_clients_per_round, max_acc)` in `train.py`.
  - **Process**:
    1. **Loop Over Epochs** (1 to 200):
       - Initialize a `weight_accumulator` to store aggregated weight differences.
       - Randomly select 12 clients (`num_clients_per_round`) using `random.sample`.
       - For each selected client:
         - Call `client.local_train(server.global_model)` (in `client.py`):
           - Copy global model weights to the local model.
           - Train locally for 3 epochs:
             - Iterate over `client.train_loader` (batches of 32 samples).
             - For each batch (data: `(batch_size, 3, 140, 140)`, target: `(batch_size,)`):
               - Move to GPU if available.
               - Compute output: `output = self.local_model(data)`.
               - Calculate loss: `nn.functional.cross_entropy(output, target)`.
               - Backpropagate and update weights using SGD (`lr=0.001`, `momentum=0.0001`).
           - Compute weight differences: `diff = local_model_weights - global_model_weights`.
           - Return `diff`.
         - Add `diff` to `weight_accumulator`, scaled by `1/num_clients_per_round`.
       - Call `server.model_aggregate(weight_accumulator)` (in `server.py`):
         - Update global model weights: `global_weights += weight_accumulator * (1/12)`.
       - Evaluate global model: `server.model_eval()`:
         - Iterate over `server.eval_loader` (test dataset).
         - Compute accuracy and loss on test set (820 samples).
         - Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
         - Loss: Average cross-entropy loss.
       - Print epoch, accuracy, and loss.
       - If accuracy exceeds `max_acc` (80%), save model to `model.pth` and stop training.
  - **Output**:
    - Returns the best test accuracy.
    - Saves `model.pth` if accuracy improves or exceeds threshold.
  - **Console Output**: Prints "Starting training..." and per-epoch metrics (e.g., "Epoch X, Accuracy: Y%, Loss: Z").
- **Purpose**: Trains the global model using federated averaging, leveraging local training on client data to improve generalization while preserving privacy.

### Step 7: Evaluate Model (evaluate.py)
- **File**: `evaluate.py`
- **Action**: Load the trained model and evaluate it on the test set, generating a classification report and confusion matrix.
- **Details**:
  - **Function**: `evaluate_model(model, test_dataset, classes)`:
    - Load `model.pth` into `model`.
    - Set model to evaluation mode: `model.eval()`.
    - Create `DataLoader` for `test_dataset` (820 samples, `batch_size=32`).
    - For each batch:
      - Compute predictions: `pred = output.data.max(1)[1]`.
      - Collect true labels and predictions.
    - Compute classification report using `sklearn.metrics.classification_report`:
      - Metrics: Precision, recall, F1-score for each class (A1–A11).
    - Compute confusion matrix using `sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix`.
    - Plot confusion matrix using `seaborn.heatmap` and save as `confusion_matrix.png`.
  - **Console Output**: Prints "Evaluating model..." and the classification report.
  - **Output Files**: Saves `confusion_matrix.png`.
- **Purpose**: Assesses the model’s performance on the test set, providing detailed metrics for each activity class.

### Step 8: Output and Artifacts
- **Files Generated**:
  - `model.pth`: Trained global model weights (saved if accuracy improves or exceeds 80%).
  - `confusion_matrix.png`: Visualization of the confusion matrix for test set predictions.
- **Console Output**:
  - Progress messages: "Loading data...", "Initializing model...", etc.
  - Epoch-wise training metrics: Accuracy and loss.
  - Classification report: Metrics per class.
- **Dataset Sizes**:
  - Training: 1645 samples (329 combinations × 5 sensors).
  - Test: 820 samples (164 combinations × 5 sensors).
  - Each sample: 3x140x140 tensor, label (0–10).

## Integration with Preprocessing
- **Input Data**: The training pipeline relies on `Train_data.pkl` and `Test_data.pkl` from `fall_detection_preprocessing`:
  - **Preprocessing Steps**:
    - `sensor_processing.py`: Generates `GAF_data` (GAF images for sensors).
    - `camera_processing.py`: Generates `Camera_data` (camera difference images).
    - `data_fusion.py`: Combines into `GAF_Camera_data`.
    - `dataset_splitting.py`: Splits into training (Trials 1–2, 329 combinations) and test (Trial 3, 164 combinations) sets.
  - **Verification**: The preprocessing output ("Saved 329 training samples and 164 test samples") matches the expected number of combinations, confirming correct data preparation.
- **Flattening in Training**: The training pipeline flattens the data (1645 training, 820 test samples) to treat each sensor’s data as a separate sample, aligning with the model’s input requirements.

## Key Modifications
- **Shape Mismatch Fix** (`model.py`):
  - Updated `nn.Linear(588, 11)` to `nn.Linear(2700, 11)` to match the flattened output of convolutional layers (12 × 15 × 15 = 2700).
- **Tensor Warning Fix** (`client.py`, `server.py`):
  - Replaced `torch.tensor(target)` with `target.detach().clone()` to avoid `UserWarning` about tensor copying.
- **Dataset Flattening** (`main.py`):
  - Modified dataset creation to flatten sensor data, creating 1645 training and 820 test samples.
  - Added print statements to verify dataset sizes.

## Notes
- **Memory Usage**:
  - Training set: ~773 MB (1645 × 3 × 140 × 140 × 8 bytes).
  - Test set: ~385 MB (820 × 3 × 140 × 140 × 8 bytes).
  - Ensure sufficient memory, especially with GPU usage.
- **Performance**:
  - Training may be slow due to the large dataset and `float64` precision. Consider reducing `num_epochs` or using `float32` (`model.float()`).
- **Client Distribution**:
  - Data is distributed by subject (15 clients, ~110 samples each). Alternative distributions (e.g., random) are possible but require modifying `main.py`.
- **Debugging**:
  - Verify data shapes in `client.py`:
    ```python
    print(f"Data shape: {data.shape}, Target shape: {target.shape}")
    ```
  - Check pickle file contents if sizes differ from expected.

## Conclusion
The `fall_detection_training` pipeline implements federated learning to train a CNN for fall detection using the UP-Fall Detection Dataset. It processes 1645 training and 820 test samples, each a 3x140x140 tensor, across 15 clients. The process involves loading preprocessed data, initializing a model, distributing data, training locally, aggregating updates, and evaluating performance. Modifications ensure compatibility with the preprocessing pipeline and fix errors, resulting in a robust training workflow.
