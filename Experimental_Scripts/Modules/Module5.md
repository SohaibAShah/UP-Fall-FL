Module 5 — Missing modalities and an IMU‑driven gate (energy/latency aware)
Intuition

Real deployments lose sensors (camera off, occlusions). Train the model to be robust when a modality is missing, and gate the heavy branch to save energy.
Key equations

Modality dropout during training: sample a mask m ∈ {0,1}^M and zero out missing modalities; minimize E_m [ℓ(fθ(X ⊙ m), y)].
Energy/latency budget model: expected cost C = C_light + p_trigger · C_heavy, where p_trigger is gate’s trigger probability.
Gate as a classifier: p_trigger = σ(g(ϕ_IMU(X_I))); wake heavy branch if p_trigger > τ.
Mini‑example

Train residual fusion with 30% probability of dropping RGB at training time. Deploy with a gate that triggers RGB only when IMU confidence is low or “fall‑like.”
Small assignment

Measure accuracy with and without modality dropout when RGB is absent at test time.
Estimate expected latency/energy before vs after gating (even simple timing/energy proxies are fine).
Stretch: learn τ to meet a target energy budget (constrained optimization).

### Code Explanation

This script is designed to build and evaluate an advanced multimodal model for fall detection that is both **robust** to sensor failure and **energy-efficient**. It achieves this by combining several key concepts.

#### 1\. Setup and Data Loading

  * **Setup**: The initial part of the script imports necessary libraries (`torch`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, etc.) and defines helper functions, including `set_seed` for reproducible results.
  * **`load_and_process_data`**: This function is the data pipeline. It loads the IMU sensor data from `sensor.csv` and image data from two cameras. Its most critical task is to perform an **optimized alignment** of these three data sources, ensuring that every IMU reading, camera 1 image, and camera 2 image in a given sample correspond to the exact same moment in time. Finally, it splits the data into training, validation, and test sets.

#### 2\. The GatedResidualFusionModel Architecture 🧠

This is the core of the project. It's a sophisticated model designed to be both accurate and efficient.

  * **Encoders**: It has three "encoder" networks: one `IMUEncoder` (a 1D-CNN) to process sensor data, and two `ImageEncoder`s (2D-CNNs) to process data from the two cameras. These encoders extract meaningful features from each data type.
  * **IMU-driven Gate**: This is a small, separate neural network that looks *only* at the features from the lightweight IMU sensor. Its job is to make a quick decision: "Is this situation ambiguous or potentially a fall?" It outputs a probability (p\_trigger) indicating how confident it is that the cameras are needed.
  * **Two Classifiers ("Heads")**: The model has two decision-making paths:
    1.  An **`imu_only_classifier`** that makes a prediction using only the IMU data. This is the default, low-energy path.
    2.  A **`fused_classifier`** that combines features from the IMU and both cameras. This is the powerful, high-energy path.
  * **Conditional Forward Pass**:
      * **During Training**: The model always calculates both paths. It uses a special technique called **modality dropout**, where it randomly ignores the camera data 30% of the time. This forces the `imu_only_classifier` to become strong on its own.
      * **During Evaluation (Inference)**: The gate makes a hard decision. If its trigger probability is above a set threshold (e.g., 0.5), the model activates the powerful image encoders and uses the `fused_classifier`. If not, it saves energy by keeping the image encoders off and uses the `imu_only_classifier`.

-----

#### 3\. Training and Evaluation

  * **`train_gated_model`**: This function trains the model. Its most important feature is the implementation of **modality dropout**. Before feeding data to the model, it randomly zeroes out the image tensors with a 30% probability, simulating camera failures and forcing the model to learn to be robust.
  * **`evaluate_gated_model`**: This function tests the trained model. It measures the F1-score (a key performance metric for fall detection) and the **trigger rate**—the percentage of time the IMU-driven gate decided to activate the cameras.

-----

#### 4\. Main Execution Block (The Assignments)

This final section runs the experiments defined in the assignment.

  * **Assignment 1: Robustness Test**:
    1.  It first trains a **baseline model** without modality dropout.
    2.  It then trains the **robust model** with 30% modality dropout.
    3.  It evaluates both models on a special test set where the camera data has been completely zeroed out, simulating a total camera failure. This directly tests which model is more robust.
  * **Assignment 2: Energy Savings Test**:
    1.  It takes the trained robust model and evaluates it on a normal test set.
    2.  It calculates the camera trigger rate and uses a simple proxy (`cost_imu = 1`, `cost_image = 10`) to estimate the computational savings achieved by the gating mechanism compared to always having the cameras on.
  * **Stretch Goal: Learning a Threshold (τ)**:
    1.  Instead of using a fixed threshold of 0.5, this part calculates a new threshold `τ` that would cause the cameras to activate on only the top 40% most uncertain samples.
    2.  It then re-evaluates the model with this new, budget-aware threshold to see how performance is affected.

### Output Explanation

Your output shows that the experiments ran successfully. Let's break down what the results mean.

#### Assignment 1: Robustness Comparison

```
--- Robustness Comparison ---
                Model  F1 on RGB-Absent Data
Baseline (No Dropout)               0.000751
Robust (With Dropout)               0.952785
```

  * **Insight**: This is a dramatic and successful result. When tested on data with **no images**, the **baseline model completely failed** (F1-score is near zero), as it had become overly reliant on the cameras during training.
  * In contrast, the **robust model**, which was trained with modality dropout, achieved an excellent **F1-score of 0.95**. This proves that forcing the model to occasionally work without images made it highly effective at using the IMU data alone when needed.

#### Assignment 2: Gating Performance

```
--- Gating Performance (Threshold=0.5) ---
                    Metric  Value
           F1-Score (Fall) 0.9845
       Camera Trigger Rate 91.61%
Cost Before Gating (Proxy)     21
 Cost After Gating (Proxy)  19.32
                   Savings  7.99%
```

  * **Insight**: With a standard 0.5 threshold, the model achieved a very high **F1-score of 0.98**. However, to do so, the gate was quite cautious and decided to activate the cameras **91.61%** of the time.
  * This resulted in a modest **energy/latency saving of 7.99%**. While the model is accurate, it's not yet very efficient.

-----

#### Stretch Goal: Learning a Threshold for a Budget

```
--- Stretch Goal: Learn Threshold τ for 40% Energy Budget ---
Learned Threshold τ = 0.9054 to meet 40% budget.
Performance with learned τ: F1-Score=0.9384, Actual Trigger Rate=40.09%
```

  * **Insight**: This is the most interesting result. To meet the strict energy budget of only using the cameras 40% of the time, the model needed a much higher confidence threshold (`τ = 0.9054`).
  * Even with the cameras off for 60% of the test samples, the model maintained a very strong **F1-score of 0.9384**.
  * This demonstrates a powerful trade-off: you can achieve a significant (**\~57%** reduction in camera usage compared to the 91.61% trigger rate) while only sacrificing a small amount of performance. This is the core benefit of an IMU-driven gate.
